    "To make **FrequentWords** faster, we will think about why this algorithm is slow in the first place. It slides a window of length k down Text, identifying a k mer Pattern of Text at each step. For each such k-mer, it must slide a window down the entire length of Text in order to compute `PatternCount(Text, Pattern)`. Instead of doing all this sliding, we aspire to slide a window down Text only once. As we slide this window, we will keep track of the number of times that each k-mer Pattern has already appeared in Text, updating these numbers as we proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we will first order all $4^k$ k-mers lexicographically (i.e., according to how they would appear in the dictionary) and then convert them into the $4^k$ different integers between 0 and $4^k − 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer $k$, we define the frequency array of a string Text as an array of length $4^k$, where the i-th element of the array holds the number of times that the i-th k-mer (in the lexicographic order) appears in Text (see figure below).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the frequency array, we need to determine how to transform a k-mer Pattern into an integer using a function `PatternToNumber(Pattern)`. We also should know how to reverse this process, transforming an integer between 0 and $4^k − 1$ into a k-mer using a function `NumberToPattern(index, k)`.\n",
    "\n",
    " In the figure below, we can see that `PatternToNumber(GT) = 11` and `NumberToPattern(11, 2) = GT`.\n",
